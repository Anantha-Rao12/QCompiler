# QOSF Cohort 3 Screening Tasks

- I have implemented a basic Quantum Circuit Simulator (task 3) as mentioned on the [screening taks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1944peQceYXhRA4Usp6ub_l2ms1xj8mXgseCgWpyBZOA/edit) for the QOSF program. 
- The jupyter notebook `3_QC_simulator.ipynb` contains basic implementations and syntax based on the `QuantumCircuit()` class described in `qc_simulator.py`. 
- I have implemented : 
  - The basic single-qubit gates (X,Y,Z,I,H,S,T) and the CNOT gate 
  - Multi-shot measurement of all qubits using a weighted random technique
  
- Any constructive criticism orsuggestions are welcomed! I am currently working on incorporating parametric gates into the setup. 



Thank you and have a wonderful day!
